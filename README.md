# fully_actuated_quadrotor
Support files to implement in both, simulation and real experiments, our proposed fully-actuated quadrotor with flaps

## Replace the files

In iris model's folder, replace the sdf file of this repositoy, unzip and paste the stl quad-rotor model into the meshes folder. This will replace the common iris quad-rotor into our proposed flap quad-rotor.

## Adding the modified plug-ins for the SITL simulation

In order to perform the simulations of out quad-rotor model, it is necessary to add the modified plug-ins in the src folder of the sitl-simulation files. For this
